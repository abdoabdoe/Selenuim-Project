Automated Test Script Documentation

The provided code consists of two separate Selenium WebDriver test scripts: Openbrowser and forgetpassward. Below, you'll find documentation for each of these scripts.

Openbrowser Script
Purpose
The Openbrowser script automates a series of actions on the eBay website, including signing in, navigating to a product, and initiating a purchase.

Key Steps
Open eBay website.
Sign in with a user account.
Navigate to a specific product.
Open a new tab and proceed with the product purchase.
Code Structure
The code is structured as a standalone Java application. The main method contains the automation steps.

Execution Flow
Set up ChromeDriver and navigate to the eBay website.
Perform the sign-in process.
Navigate to a specific product and open it in a new tab.
Switch to the new tab and complete the purchase process.
Dependencies
Selenium WebDriver: Handles browser interactions.
ChromeDriver: WebDriver implementation for the Chrome browser.
Additional Comments
Thread.sleep usage: Introducing sleep between actions may lead to flakiness. It's recommended to use explicit waits (WebDriverWait) to synchronize with the web elements.
Hard-coded values: Credentials and form fields are hard-coded. Consider using configuration files or externalizing these values for better maintainability.
forgetpassward Script
Purpose
The forgetpassward script automates the process of initiating a password reset on the Jumia website.

Key Steps
Open Jumia login page.
Click on the "Forgot Password" link.
Enter the email address and proceed.
Code Structure
Similar to Openbrowser, the script is structured as a standalone Java application with the automation steps in the main method.

Execution Flow
Set up ChromeDriver and navigate to the Jumia login page.
Click on the "Forgot Password" link.
Enter the email address and proceed with the password reset.
Dependencies
Selenium WebDriver: Handles browser interactions.
ChromeDriver: WebDriver implementation for the Chrome browser.
Additional Comments
Thread.sleep usage: Similar to the Openbrowser script, consider using explicit waits instead of hard-coded sleeps for better reliability.
General Recommendations
Code Organization: Consider organizing the code into separate methods for better readability and maintainability.
Exception Handling: Implement proper exception handling to handle unexpected issues during script execution.
Data Privacy: Avoid hard-coding sensitive information directly into the script. Utilize configuration files or external sources.
Documentation: Document the test scenarios and expected outcomes for reference.
Conclusion
Both scripts demonstrate basic web automation using Selenium WebDriver, and they can serve as a starting point for more complex scenarios. To enhance the scripts, consider incorporating best practices like modularization, logging, and error handling.
